******P-Mart Store Sales Analysis Project******************/n
**Project Overview**
The P-Mart Sales Analysis project was designed to analyze annual sales data and generate meaningful insights that will aid P-Mart in understanding its customers and formulating growth strategies for the upcoming year. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on data cleaning, processing, analysis, and dashboard creation.

**Tools Used**
Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, processing, analysis, and dashboard creation)

**Steps Involved**
**1. Data Cleaning**
The primary cleaning task involved normalizing gender data by replacing "M" with "Men" and "W" with "Women" for better clarity in analysis.
**2. Data Processing**
Age Grouping: An "Age Group" column was created to categorize customers based on their age, helping identify trends across different demographics.
Monthly Sales: A new "Month" column was derived from the "Date" column to facilitate monthly sales trend analysis, answering key questions such as identifying the month with the highest sales.
**3. Data Analysis**
Various Pivot Tables were created to answer specific business questions and uncover patterns in the sales data:
Sales vs Orders: Analyzed monthly sales and order volumes to visualize trends and fluctuations over time.
Sales by Gender: Visualized the sales split between men and women, showing which gender contributed the most to overall sales.
Order Status: Categorized orders based on their status (Delivered, Refunded, Returned, Canceled).
Top 5 Sales States: Identified the top-performing regions/states by sales volume.
Age vs Gender: Explored the relationship between age and gender to determine which demographics were more likely to purchase.
Order Channels: Analyzed the performance of different sales channels (e.g., Ajio, Amazon, Flipkart, etc.).
**4. Dashboard Creation**
A dynamic, interactive dashboard was built in Excel, allowing the end-users to:
Filter data by Month, Category, and Channel.
View key sales metrics and trends in real-time through various pivot charts and slicers.
Drill down into the data to focus on specific areas of interest, such as sales by gender or sales by region.
